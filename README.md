# Introduction 
Introducing A brand new programming language. {name yet to be decided}.

Not so familiar to English and finding trouble in learning and understanding programming concepts due to difficult nomenclature(naming) of concepts no issues. We have our language in simple hindi so new developers need not get into remembering those difficult words ,you can focus on more logical and concepts like backtracking algorithms ,Dynamic Programming {later these too would get simplified so do not worry}
# Features
The language has all features of a traditional programming language starting form looping, standard String and Math methords to OOP concepts like classes, inheritance and concepts like threads and processes, file handling , networking, user defined data structures including traditional datastructures like trees, graphs and much more.

Got familiar with a traditional programming language no worries specific files would be available at the official site for respective languages usinh which you would be able to embed the code directly and you would be able to shift between your  traditional programming language and our language with ease . Currently the compiler in [here](https://crptrest.000webhostapp.com/)  supports our language
and java so you can embed java any where and our language.E.g.`int a=0;अंक अ =0;` would work completely fine int belongs to java and अंक  to our language .
# Site
The  documentation of the language live is available at 
[docs](https://prathameshbhagat.000webhostapp.com/Docs/)

# Open Source
This is completely open source project and even small updates are appreciated so feel free to enhance this repository .
