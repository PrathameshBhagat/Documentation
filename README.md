# Introduction 
Introducing A brand new programming language. {name yet to be decided}.

Not so familiar to English and finding trouble in learning and understanding programming concepts due to difficult nomenclature(naming) of concepts no issues. We have our language in simple hindi so new developers need not get into remembering those difficult words ,you can focus on more logical and concepts like backtracking algorithms ,Dynamic Programming {later these too would get simplified so do not worry}
# Features
The language has all features of a traditional programming language starting form looping, standard String and Math methords to OOP concepts like classes, inheritance and concepts like threads and processes, file handling , networking, user defined data structures including traditional datastructures like trees, graphs and much more.{The language is very similar to java so if you know java shifting would be very easy}

# Additional Features 
Already got familiar with a traditional programming language, no worries ,specific files would be available at the official site for respective languages using which you would be able to embed the code directly and you would be able to shift between your traditional programming language and our language with ease. Currently the compiler in [here](https://crptrest.000webhostapp.com/)  supports our language and java so you can embed java any where and our language.E.g.`int a=0;अंक अ =0;` would work completely fine int belongs to java and अंक to our language.

Also the language uses a refrence compiler so the refrenced compiler's language features would be natively suppported . 

Soon .jar file would be provided through which you would be able to add code of our language in your java projects easily and support of other languages like Python ,C ,C# would be provided later.   

# Site
The  documentation of the language live is available at 
[docs](https://prathameshbhagat.000webhostapp.com/Docs/)

# Open Source
This is completely open source project and even small updates are appreciated so feel free to enhance this repository .
